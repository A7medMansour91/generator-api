## Getting started

- Make sure you have [yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed on your machine:
    `npm install -g yo`
- Install the generator **globally**: `npm install -g generator-api`
- Run: `yo generator-api`. Or run  `yo` and choose the `Rest Api Generator` option
- Run: `npm run dev` to start the local server at `localhost:8080`,


## To Do
* Add to README how is the project's architecture, and tips on how to scale from the generated project
* Give the generator more startup options
*  Create more generator templates to create new controllers / models / schemas once the project was initialized
* Implement testings,  in both the generator and generated projects
